# Analytics & Traffic Setup Guide

## üîç Immediate Actions (Week 1)

### 1. Google Analytics 4 Setup
**Priority: HIGH** - Essential for understanding legitimate traffic vs bot traffic

#### Steps:
1. **Create GA4 Property**
   - Go to https://analytics.google.com
   - Create new property for `coinoffate.live`
   - Set timezone and currency

2. **Add Tracking Code**
   - Add this to `index.html` in the `<head>` section (BEFORE closing `</head>`):

```html
<!-- Google Analytics 4 -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX', {
    'anonymize_ip': true,
    'allow_google_signals': false
  });
</script>
```

3. **Configure Enhanced Measurement**
   - Enable: Page views, Scrolls, Outbound clicks, Site search, Video engagement
   - Disable: File downloads (unless needed)

4. **Set Up Key Events**
   - Coin flip initiated (`click` on flip button)
   - Premium upgrade clicked
   - Modal interactions
   - Time on site milestones (30s, 1min, 2min)

### 2. Google Search Console Setup
**Priority: HIGH** - Critical for SEO visibility

#### Steps:
1. **Verify Domain Ownership**
   - Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Add property: `coinoffate.live`
   - Verify using Google Analytics (easiest) or HTML tag method
   - You already have `googled12f2543fb895005.html` - ensure it's in the root directory

2. **Submit Sitemap**
   - Submit: `https://coinoffate.live/sitemap.xml`
   - Monitor indexing status weekly

3. **Monitor Core Web Vitals**
   - Check mobile usability
   - Track LCP, FID, CLS scores
   - Address any issues flagged

4. **Set Up URL Inspection**
   - Request indexing for new pages
   - Monitor crawl errors
   - Fix any coverage issues

---

### 3. Bot Protection & Rate Limiting

#### Option A: Netlify Edge Functions (FREE)
Create rate limiting to block scanner bots:

**File:** `netlify/edge-functions/rate-limit.js`
```javascript
export default async (request, context) => {
  const ip = context.ip;
  const pathname = new URL(request.url).pathname;

  // Block known attack paths
  const blockedPaths = [
    '/wp-admin', '/wordpress', '/.env', '/.git',
    '/phpmyadmin', '/xmlrpc.php', '/admin'
  ];

  if (blockedPaths.some(path => pathname.startsWith(path))) {
    return new Response('Not Found', { status: 404 });
  }

  return context.next();
};

export const config = { path: "/*" };
```

#### Option B: Cloudflare (Recommended for production)
1. **Set up Cloudflare** (FREE tier)
   - Add `coinoffate.live` to Cloudflare
   - Enable "Under Attack" mode temporarily to filter bots
   - Configure Bot Fight Mode (free)

2. **Rate Limiting Rules**
   - Block IPs making >100 requests/minute
   - Challenge suspicious traffic patterns
   - Enable Browser Integrity Check

---

### 4. Fix Current Analytics Issues

#### Problem Analysis:
- **219 page views / 5MB bandwidth** = ~23KB per view
- This is suspiciously consistent - likely bot traffic
- WordPress scanner attacks (wp-admin, wp-login) are polluting metrics

#### Solutions:
1. **Filter Bot Traffic in GA4**
   - Settings ‚Üí Data Filters ‚Üí Create filter
   - Exclude known bots/spiders
   - Filter out 404 pages from analytics

2. **Block Scanner IPs**
   - Review access logs in Netlify
   - Identify top scanner IPs
   - Add to Netlify banned IP list

3. **Add Honeypot Links** (Optional)
   - Create hidden links that bots follow
   - Track and block IPs that access them

## üìà SEO Strategy (Weeks 2-8)

### Week 2-3: Technical SEO Foundation

#### 1. **Optimize Current Meta Tags**
‚úÖ Already have: Title, description, OG tags, structured data
‚ú® **Enhance:**

<!-- This reduces load time by ~300ms -->

<!-- Add resource hints (already partially done) -->
<link rel="preload" as="style" href="path/to/critical.css">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://www.googletagmanager.com">
```

#### 3. **Mobile Optimization**
- Ensure touch targets are 48√ó48px minimum
- Test on real devices
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals:
  - LCP < 2.5s
  - FID < 100ms
  - CLS < 0.1
